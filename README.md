# Rainfall Simulation

By simulating the paths of millions of raindrops on a terrain (generated using simplex noise), you can realistically visualise the beautiful effect that hydraulic erosion has in the real world.

This project was written in C# using the Unity engine, and a .exe file is available below for Windows machines only.
